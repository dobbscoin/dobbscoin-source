What is DobbsCoin?
----------------
READ THIS: http://www.dobbscoin.info/smf/index.php?topic=35.0

DobbsCoin is a peer to peer settlement instrument, a 'currency like
electronic document', not to be confused with 'Legal Tender'. 
DobbsCoin enables instant Slack to anyone, anywhere in the world,
using peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority. 

Managing transactions and issuing Slack is carried out collectively
by the users clients within the DobbsCoin network. 


License
-------

DobbsCoin is based on Bitcoin.
Its development tracks Bitcoin's. 

The following information applies to Bitcoin's developemnt.
Copyright (c) 2009-2013 Bitcoin Developers
-------------------

BitCoin is released under the terms of the MIT license. See `COPYING` for more
information or see http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think
their feature or bug fix is ready.

If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the Bitcoin
development team members simply pulls it.

If it is a *more complicated or potentially controversial* change, then the patch
submitter will be asked to start a discussion (if they haven't already) on the
[mailing list](http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=bitcoin-development).

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing.
Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn't
match the project's coding conventions (see `doc/coding.md`) or are
controversial.

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Bitcoin.

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test. Please be patient and help out, and
remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write unit tests for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code.

Unit tests for the core code are in `src/test/`. To compile and run them:

    cd src; make -f makefile.unix test

Unit tests for the GUI code are in `src/qt/test/`. To compile and run them:

    qmake BITCOIN_QT_TEST=1 -o Makefile.test bitcoin-qt.pro
    make -f Makefile.test
    ./bitcoin-qt_test
